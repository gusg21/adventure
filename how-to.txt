So, you've gotten bored of the elaborate game already created? Well, here's how to make it more interesting!

If you look in the "main" folder, you will see the options are folders. The text describing the area is in 
"text.txt". And when you choose an option, you go inside the option's folder, which will also have options. 
And so on. If you know a thing or two about batch, you can place code to run when you choose an option.
Just place it in the option folder and call it "script.bat". With this you can create more complex games!

Happy Gaming!
